The improved K-means algorithm has several advantages over the original brute-force implementation:
- Efficiency: The improved algorithm uses several optimization techniques, such as precomputing distances between points and centroids, 
    utilizing move semantics to avoid unnecessary copying of objects, and implementing an early stopping criterion based on centroid convergence. 
    These optimizations reduce the overall computational complexity and improve the algorithm's efficiency.
- Scalability: 
    By precomputing distances and implementing more efficient centroid updates, the improved algorithm can handle larger datasets and higher-dimensional 
    feature spaces more effectively. It can scale better to larger datasets without significantly increasing execution time.
- Accuracy: The use of K-means++ initialization in the improved algorithm leads to better initial centroid selection. K-means++ tends to produce more 
    representative initial centroids, leading to improved clustering results and better convergence properties.
- Readability and Maintainability: The improved algorithm's code is more organized, modular, and easier to understand due to the use of separate functions for 
    different steps of the algorithm. This makes the codebase more maintainable and allows for easier debugging and future enhancements.

Overall, the improved K-means algorithm provides better performance, scalability, accuracy, and maintainability compared to the original brute-force 
implementation, making it a more suitable choice for clustering tasks in practice.
